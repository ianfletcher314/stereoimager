Why it matches the StereoImager plugin color scheme:
---------------------------------------------------
The StereoImager plugin uses a multi-color scheme with Neve-style knobs:
- Primary accent: Blue (#4a9eff)
- Green accent: (#22c55e)
- Purple accent: (#9b59b6)
- Neve knob colors: Cream (#E8E0D0), Orange (#D97030), Blue (#4080C0)
- Background: Dark (#1a1a1a)
- Correlation colors: Green (good), Yellow (warn), Red (bad)

This tropical foliage image features:
- Rich green tones matching the plugin's green accent and correlation indicator
- Purple undertones complementing the purple accent color
- Organic textures that contrast with the technical stereo imaging function
- Brazilian rainforest aesthetic (Amazon-inspired tropical leaves)

Recommended usage:
- Apply with low opacity (10-15%) for subtle organic texture
- The green tones enhance the "healthy stereo field" visual metaphor
- Works well behind the correlation meter and stereo field display
- Creates an interesting contrast between nature and technical audio tools
